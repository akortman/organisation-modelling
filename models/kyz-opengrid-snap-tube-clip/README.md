This uses [KYZ Design](https://makerworld.com/en/@KYZDesign)'s OpenGrid Heavy/Hybrid snap design.

To render this, we need the snap .stl from their ["openGrid KV Fitting Remix Base"](https://makerworld.com/en/models/1846653-opengrid-kv-fitting-remix-base#profileId-1973456). Download and move the file
`KYZ oG KV1-S Fitting Base V1.11 for Slicer.stl` into this directory, renaming to `kv1.stl`. Then the OpenSCAD files
will pull in and position the snap accordingly.
